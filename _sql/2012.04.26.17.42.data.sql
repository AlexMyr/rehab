(899, 'Ice the plantar fascia', 'Place an ice pack under the heel while sitting to reduce inflammtion and pain.'),
(900, 'Crutches - how to measure', 'Its important to adjust the crutch to the correct height as crutches that are too short or too tall can put you off balance or cause strain to other areas such as the back. First, put your shoes on. Then place the crutch next to your leg, and make sure the handle is level with the bony part of hip (along the same line as your pubic region). Next make sure the forearm rest is just below the elbow crease.'),
(901, 'Crutches - how to walk if you cannot weight bear on one leg', 'Place the crutches in front of you, and then move your weaker limb forward, then bear all your weight down through the crutches and move your stronger unaffected limb forward. Repeat. This is an excellent method of walking if you cannot put any weight through one leg.'),
(902, 'Crutches - how to walk if you cannot weight bear through both legs', 'Advance both crutches forward then, while bearing all your weight down through both crutches, swing both legs forward at the same time past the crutches. This is energy consuming and requires good upper body strength, so if you cannot do this, you should consider a wheelchair.'),
(903, 'Crutches - walking with weakness/poor co-ordination in both legs', 'Use the left crutch, then your right foot, then the right crutch, then your left foot. Then repeat. This method provides excellent stability as there are always three points of contact with the ground.'),
(904, 'One crutch - how to walk', 'Hold the crutch on the side of the non-affected leg. Its common to want to use the crutch on the injured side, but this doesn''t tend to be as supportive. When walking swing the crutch through as you step with the affected side. The crutch and your foot should hit the floor at the same time. Then step through with the unaffected leg.'),
(905, 'Walking up and down stairs', 'When walking upstairs, always step with the good leg first, and then follow with the affected leg. When walking downstairs, always walk with the affected leg first, and then follow with the good leg. Remember this saying: Up with the good, and down with the bad. Or: the good go to heaven, the bad go to hell!'),
(906, 'Walking up and down stairs with one crutch', 'Always try to use one crutch and hold on to a side-rail when walking up and down stairs. To go up, bring your good leg up first, and your affected leg up afterwards, and last bring your crutch onto the step. To go down, first place your crutch on the step below, then bring your affected leg down a step, then your good leg.'),
(907, 'Walking up and down stairs with two crutches', 'Always try to use one crutch and hold on to a side-rail when walking up and down stairs. But if this is not possible, use two crutches. First take a step up with your good leg, then follow it up with the affected leg, then bring both crutches up to the same step. To go down, place the crutches on the step below, then your affected leg, and finally your good leg.'),
(908, 'Toe flexion', 'Bend your toe(s) downwards. This will help improve mobility of your toes.'),
(909, 'Toe flexion both sides', 'Bend your toe(s) downwards. This will help improve mobility to your toes.'),
(910, 'Toe flexion passive', 'Using your hand, bend your toe(s) downwards. This will help improve mobility to your toe.'),
(911, 'Big toe bend', 'Bend your big toe downwards. Mobility in the big toe is very important for foot function, and doing this exercise will help improve mobility.'),
(912, 'Towel pick-up', 'Try to pick up a towel using your toes. This exercise will help improve strength in your toes and intrinisc foot muscles.'),
(913, 'Big toe flexion band', 'Place a thin band around your big toe, and push the toe downwards creating resistance in the band. This exercise will help you gain strength and mobility to your big toe.'),
(914, 'Toe extension', 'Bend your toe(s) upwards. This will help improve mobility to your toes.'),
(915, 'Toe extension both sides', 'Bend your toe(s) upwards. This will help improve mobility to your toes.'),
(916, 'Toe extension passive', 'Using your hand, bend your toe(s) upwards. This will help improve mobility to your toes.'),
(917, 'Big toe extension band', 'Place a thin band around your big toe, and pull the toe upwards creating resistance in the band.'),
(918, 'Big toe stretch', 'Place your big toe over a step and drop your foot down to bend your big toe upwards. Hold this stretch. Mobility in the big toe is very important for foot function, and doing this exercise will help improve mobility.'),
(919, 'Toe abduction band', 'Place a band around your toes, and open them outwards. This exercise will help improve strength in your toes and intrinisc foot muscles.'),
(920, 'Big toe abduction', 'Try to learn to move your big toe away from the other toes. Its difficult and may take some practice to learn to activate the muscles to do this. You may find it useful to move the big toe using your fingers to assist you. This will help strengthen the big toe muscles, reducing the liklihood of bunions.'),
(921, 'Big toe abduction passive', 'Move your big toe away from your other toes using your fingers. This is a useful mobility exercise for the big toe, especially for those at risk of bunions.'),
(922, 'Toe adduction squeeze', 'Place some wedges or cotton buds between your toes, and squeeze inwards. This exercise will help improve strength in your toes and intrinisc foot muscles.');
