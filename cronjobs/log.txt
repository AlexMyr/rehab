Our research shows that the optimal number of exercises to give a patient at any one time is 4. So be careful with putting too many exercises on one exercise programme as your patient compliance may be lower. 

Did you know you can use photos or lineart? Just select which you prefer for each particular patient. Photos look great when you print your exercise sheets in colour and on slightly thicker paper! Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/955BPMQShPo">video tutorial</a> that will show you how to edit your exercise programme.
